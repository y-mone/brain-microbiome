# Pathobiome Microspatial Heterogeneities and Risk of Postmortem Contamination in Alzheimer’s Disease Brain Microbiome
This repository contains the data from the manuscript: "Microspatial Heterogeneities and Absence of Postmortem Contamination in Alzheimer’s Disease Brain Microbiota: An Alzheimer’s Pathobiome Initiative (AlzPI) study"  

### File description
The spreadsheet "data.xlsx" contains three tables:
- table S1: Sample description.
- table S2: An Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) table containing the number of reads mapping to each OTU centroid in each sample.
- table S3: OTU taxonomic assignments from domain to species level along with confidence for each level.
